- Ability to add tasks to existing to-do lists via command line arguments
- Ability to correctly organize tasks into their correct sections in the list
- Ability to delete tasks from a list
- Ability to mark, or check-off, items on the list once theyâ€™re completed 
- Ability to give multiple users on a single machine their own separate to-do lists. This is accomplished through the use of environment variables.
